## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Wristband Device:** Patients wear smart wristbands that continuously record health metrics and sync data automatically
2. **Backend (Flask):** A robust Python Flask server processes patient data from `patient_data.csv` and serves it via RESTful APIs
3. **Multi-Page Frontend:** The dashboard consists of multiple specialized pages:
   - **Healthcare Provider View (`index.html`):** Patient selection and overview dashboard
   - **Patient Dashboard (`patient-dashboard.html`):** Main patient interface with navigation
   - **Specialized Views:** Dedicated pages for vitals, medications, symptoms, communication, reports, and appointments
4. **Real-Time Updates:** Automatic data refresh and live health monitoring
5. **Patient Navigation:** Seamless transitions between different health management sections

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Running the Dashboard

1. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```sh
   python "from flask import Flask, jsonify.py"
   ```
2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   - **Healthcare Provider Dashboard:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   - **Patient Dashboard:** [http://localhost:5000/patient-dashboard.html](http://localhost:5000/patient-dashboard.html)
   - **Specific Patient View:** [http://localhost:5000/patient/{patient_id}](http://localhost:5000/patient/1)
